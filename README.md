# linkedboxdraw
position connected boxes (latuile) and draw the links (bombix)

bombix and latuile are independant algorithms. They both contain a complete test suite, with a list of input and expected results.
They can be compiled independantly. If you run bombix (resp. latuile) on the command line with no argument, the test suite will be executed
and a list of OK or KO will be printed to the command line.
That's basically all you need to know to run the algorithms once you have compiled the C++ code.
